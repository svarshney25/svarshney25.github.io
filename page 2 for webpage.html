  <h1>FIELD HOCKEY!</h1>
<body style="background-color: lawngreen"></body>
<p>So, as you've read on the first page of my website, I LOVE to play field hockey.
It is my favorite sport. So, here I am going to tell you about field hockey and how the game works.
I have been playing field hockey since Kindergarten, so (not to brag) I'm pretty good at it.</p>
<h2>The gear you need to play are:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A field hockey stick (it has to be the right size. You will see if it is the right size if it goes up to your waist)</li>
    <li>Eyeguard</li>
    <li>Mouthguard</li>
    <li>Shinguards</li>
    <li>A bag to keep all of your gear in.</li>
    <li>If you want you can have a ball.</li>
    <li>You may also use gloves.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Below is a picture of the gear</h4>

<h3>Above, it is showing a bag shaped like the stick, but that is optional. You don't need it. All you need is a bag.</h3>

<h2 style="color:aqua;">TIPS</h2>
<h3>When you play you should position yourslef so that your ready to run and boost off at any minute.</h3>
<h2 style="color:blueviolet;">RULES</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You should keep your sticks down at all times unless you are hitting the ball.</li>
  <li>When you are hitting the ball you should not raise your stick higher than your waist.</li>
  <li>When you hit the ball, you HAVE to hit the ball with the flat side of you stick, otherwise it will be a foul.</li>
</ul>
 <h2 style="color:blue;">DIFFERENT TYPES OF PASSES</h2> 
<h3>There are a few kind of passes such as push passes, drives, and sweeps. Usually, people use push passes.</h3>
<h3>A drive is when you lift your stick above your waist (as long as if there is no one behind you, you can lift it pretty high) and you hit the ball with a lot of power. You have to keep your hands together with no spaces in between. </h3>

<h3>A push pass is when you push the ball with your stick. You should not hear a sound when you push the ball.</h3>

<h3>A sweep is when you keep your hands together on the grip with no space in between. You keep your stick below your left knee.</h3>
