<h2>India is the country of my origin. My whole family was born there except me.</h2>
<h3>India is one of my favorite places to go. During the summer, in Delhi, the temperature can get to 110 degrees Fahrenheit!</h3>
<h3>My cousins live in the suburbs of Delhi.</h3>
<h2>If you are going to go to India anytime soon or if you're just looking at this page to learn about India, this will definitely give you a lot of information.</h2>
